    "- Is the violent crimes rate in Maryland increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? During this project, you will find out. First, wrangle the raw data supplied by State of Maryland. Second, analyze the data using a hierarchical regression to examine both the statewide crime rate and crime rate for each Maryland county. Third, plot the changes in crime rates for each county. \n",
    "- Like most data science work, this project requires both R and statistical skills. For R, this includes proficiency with the Tidyverse, including `ggplot2`. These skills are taught in DataCamp Courses such as [Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse), [Data Manipulation in R with dplyr](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/dplyr-data-manipulation-r-tutorial), or [Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1). For statistics, this includes [Hierarchical and Mixed Effects Models](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/hierarchical-and-mixed-effects-models) and [Multiple and logistic regression](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/multiple-and-logistic-regression).\n",
    "- You will use the [crime statistics](http://goccp.maryland.gov/crime-statistics/) from the State of Maryland. The Maryland Statistical Analysis Center provides this and updates data. For the project, you will analyze data from 1975 to 2016."
