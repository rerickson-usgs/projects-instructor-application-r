Counties and county-level governments vary even within the same state. For example, some counties might be densely populated and urban, other sparsely populated and rural. Hierarchical modeling allows this hierarchy to be captured and modeled. This figure shows the counties and their populations in Maryland. You will create a similar figure for their crime trends at the end of this project.\n",
